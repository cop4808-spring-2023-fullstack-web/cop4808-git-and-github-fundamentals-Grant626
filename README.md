## This is calculator app editing for Homework 2 of COP4808 Fullstack Web Development by Grant Fairfield

For this assignment I opted to create a factorial operator button, a PI operand button, a random number operand button and a square operator button. 

This is made using HTML/CSS and JavaScript

Below you will find a video of the functioning calculator
